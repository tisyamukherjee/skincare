# Skincare Ingredient Analysis Tool  

This project is a **work-in-progress** tool for cleaning and analyzing skincare product ingredient lists. Built with **Python**, it demonstrates skills in **web scraping**, **AI-driven data cleaning**, and designing **scalable data processing pipelines**.  

The goal is to create a robust system for analyzing ingredient lists, improving accuracy and consistency in skincare data to support consumer safety and transparency.  

## Project Highlights  

- **Web Scraping**: Leveraged libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium` to extract ingredient data from multiple skincare retailer websites.  
- **AI-Driven Data Cleaning**: Integrated the `llama2` model via Ollama SDK to clean ingredient lists by removing non-relevant text, showcasing proficiency in AI-driven workflows.  
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Designed a scalable pipeline using Python and Pandas to handle large datasets in CSV format, paving the way for advanced analysis.  

## Current Status  

This project is still under development and currently focuses on:  
- Implementing the cleaning workflow to reliably process and clean scraped ingredient data.  
- Refining the integration with AI models to handle diverse and noisy data effectively.  
- Preparing for future features, including ingredient safety analysis and integration with SQL databases for scalable storage and retrieval.  

## Skills Demonstrated  

- **Python Development**: Built a structured codebase for data processing and analysis.  
- **Web Scraping**: Scraped 800+ products from multiple websites, showcasing expertise in automation and data extraction.  
- **AI Integration**: Applied cutting-edge language models to solve real-world data cleaning challenges.  
- **Project Management**: Defined a clear roadmap and deliverables, balancing ongoing development with long-term project goals.  

## Roadmap  

1. Complete the cleaning functionality and ensure it scales to large datasets.  
2. Develop a robust front-end interface for user interaction and analysis visualization.  
3. Expand functionality to include ingredient categorization and safety insights.  
4. Integrate data storage solutions using SQL for enhanced scalability.
